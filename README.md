## Description

The tutorial focuses on scholars, who want to acquaint themselves with a “low threshold” — generic, simple yet powerful, and explorative — workflow of modelling, extracting, processing (queries, visualizations), and publishing of “structured data” (LOD, Semantic Web) from heterogeneous XML-sources by means of XPath. The web service used for extraction is [XTriples](https://xtriples.lod.academy). The instructors assume basic acquaintance with XML and XPath (both will be quickly revised, “cheat sheets” will be provided).
